			"I am a software engineer with a passion for thoughtful designs and clean code. I am a recent graduate from University of California, Irvine with a Bachelor's of Science degree in computer science and a specialization in informations.",
			"I have always been interested in technology and design. As a child, I was fascinated by video games like Diablo II and off-brand Space Invaders (shout out to Chicken Invaders 2: The Next Wave). As well as the structured creativity offered by origami (the art of folding paper). Since then, I have continued to explore my enthusiasm for technology by delving into new development technologies and creative avenues.",
			"In my free time, I like to read, workout, learn to play instruments, create art/DIYs, and try new things!",
			"You can also check out some of the art I made by clicking through my pictures! They're inspired by one of my favorite animation studios, Studio Ghibli."
